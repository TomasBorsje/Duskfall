# ![](https://github.com/TomasBorsje/Duskfall/blob/master/textures/citrine_dagger.png?raw=true) Duskfall

Duskfall is an MMORPG built entirely on server-side Minecraft, using Spigot.

Includes the following:
- Data-driven items, mobs, and recipes.
- An MMORPG code layer above Spigot's.
- An automatic custom resource pack generator including model overrides, allowing custom item textures in Vanilla Minecraft.
- Dockerfile + Server for easy deployment.

Future plans:
- Separate game data server (auction house, player inventories, API).
- Dynamic server scaling via the new ServerTransport packet introduced in Minecraft 1.20.5.
